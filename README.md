# SOC-26: Physics-Informed Neural Networks

This repository documents my week-by-week progress on the SOC-26: Physics-Informed Neural Networks project. It contains concise weekly reports and solved notebooks for Weeks 1–4, along with key results and findings.

## Project Goal

Build a solid practical understanding of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), neural networks trained to satisfy differential equations as part of their loss function, progressing from automatic differentiation fundamentals to solving canonical PDEs and the benchmark Burgers' equation.

Each `WeekX.md` contains:

- Short overview of the week
- Topics covered and why they matter
- Problems/assignments solved
- Key results and figures

The `solutions/` folder holds the Jupyter notebooks implementing the solved problems for that week. ( Link if uploaded file doesn't work : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10SzPzSxJl2s6ZP1kIzczt-fP4zIfiqas?usp=sharing )

## What to Expect

**Week 1 — PDEs, Neural Network Refresher & Automatic Differentiation**

- PDE classification: elliptic, parabolic, hyperbolic
- MLP architecture and forward pass in PyTorch
- Automatic differentiation using `torch.autograd.grad`
- Differentiating network outputs w.r.t. inputs (the key PINN skill)
- Verified derivatives against analytical functions (`sin(x)`, `cos(x)`, `-sin(x)`)

**Week 2 — The PINN: Architecture, Loss Function & Harmonic Oscillator**

- PINN components: network as surrogate solution, collocation points, loss construction
- PDE residual loss, initial condition loss, boundary condition loss
- Solved the damped harmonic oscillator ODE from scratch in PyTorch
- Frequency sweep experiment revealing spectral bias

**Week 3 — Canonical PDEs: Heat Equation & Wave Equation**

- Scaled from ODEs to PDEs (2D: space + time)
- Solved the 1D heat equation and 1D wave equation using DeepXDE
- Collocation sampling experiment: error vs number of collocation points
- Qualitative comparison between heat and wave equation solutions

**Week 4 — Burgers' Equation, Boundary Conditions & Classical Solver Comparison**

- Reproduced the benchmark PINN result from Raissi et al. 2019 (Burgers' equation) in pure PyTorch
- Implemented soft vs hard boundary condition enforcement
- Compared training loss curves and L2 errors for both approaches
- Written analysis: when to choose PINNs over classical FEM solvers
